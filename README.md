# üìù Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

![License: MIT](https://github.com/Bishal-Nengminja/Sentiment-Analysis-ML-Project/blob/main/LICENSE)

## üåü Project Overview

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis system** using **Machine Learning** to classify text data into sentiment categories such as **positive, negative, or neutral**.  
It demonstrates a full **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** workflow ‚Äî from data cleaning and feature extraction to model training, evaluation, and prediction ‚Äî making it a practical example of applying machine learning to real-world text analytics.

The notebook [Sentiment_Analysis_ML_Project.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FHo-VzwQ4XQN7JE_82cHt0vCoKmrNEqs) walks through the entire pipeline step by step, showcasing both **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **model performance evaluation**.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technologies

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and cleaning of raw text.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Converts text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF** and **Bag of Words**.  
- **Multiple ML Models:** Trains and evaluates classifiers such as:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree / Random Forest  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
- **Prediction Functionality:** Allows input of new text for real-time sentiment classification.  
- **Data Visualization:** Includes EDA with plots for sentiment distribution and word frequency analysis.  

### üß∞ Libraries Used

- pandas ‚Äì data handling  
- numpy ‚Äì numerical operations  
- scikit-learn ‚Äì ML models, preprocessing, metrics  
- nltk ‚Äì NLP preprocessing (stopwords, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)  
- matplotlib & seaborn ‚Äì visualization

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Dataset Loading & Cleaning**  
   Loads a sentiment dataset (CSV/text format), handles null values, and prepares it for analysis.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization & stopword removal  
   - Lemmatization/Stemming  
   - Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)  

3. **Model Training**  
   Multiple ML algorithms are trained on the processed data. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed for optimization.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Performance is assessed with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualizations.  

5. **Prediction**  
   The trained model can classify unseen text inputs into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.
